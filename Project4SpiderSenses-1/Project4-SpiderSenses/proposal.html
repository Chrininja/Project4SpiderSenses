	<h2 id="highconcept">I. High Concept</h2>

	<p>Survive as long as you can by avoiding the falling lethal liquids</p>

	<h2 id="genre">II. Genre</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Survival</li>
		<li>Avoidance</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="platform">III. Platform</h2>

	<p>It is available only on Desktop/PC</p>

	<h2 id="story">IV. Story</h2>

	<p>FLASH! A glass container shines, its glistening luminescence has panned across the spider's field of vision.
		Filled with wonder, the spider crawls toward the container, and climbs inside. Nothing too interesting at first,
		but the spider would consider this to be a lovely home. BAM! the container is closed shut from the top, the spider
		desperately tries to escape but it is unfortunately too late. Drip drop from above, the ceiling of the container
		spews out lethal liquids from the eight pipes. The scientist has captured the spider that he has been trying to
		kill for so long, and now its finally his chance to kill it. You play as the spider in this game, and your goal is
		to avoid the lethal liquids for as long as you can to survive, just to frustrate the scientist.</p>

	<h2 id="aesthetics">V. Aesthetics</h2>

	<p>Graphics will be cartoonish, and the sounds in the game will be ambient. The types of sound that the player
		will be hearing are the music that plays in the background, the effects of what happens to the spider when it
		touches one of the liquids, the little bits of sound that plays when the user starts and ends the game, and the
		powerups that the player will get throughout the game.</p>

	<h2 id="gameplay">VI. Gameplay</h2>

	<h3 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>The obvious choice that the player can make is being able to navigate throughout the different states of the
			game by pressing the specific keys that the screen tells them. When the player is in the actual game state, the
			player
			can only move in 8 directions along the glass container in 2D. This is because spiders can climb up walls. The
			player
			can avoid the lethal liquids by using these controls in order to score for the highest time survived.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Control</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Keyboard for playing and navigation</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="newuserexperience">New User Experience</h3>

	<p>There will be a separate instructional scene giving a quick overview on how the game works. It will
		be clearly obvious that the player needs to survive as long they can without getting hit by the lethal liquids.</p>

	<h3 id="playerlearning">Player Learning</h3>

	<p>There is no way of actually beating the game. The goal is to survive the longest amount of time without
		getting hit by the falling liquids. Some potential powerups include faster movement, mini umbrella that acts as an
		invincibility powerup that helps protect the spider from the dangerous liquids above. Some strategies I recommend is
		being aware of the dangers that will fall upon the player, and reacting quickly enough to avoid them.
		This is because overtime, it will get faster, and more liquids will start to pour from above.</p>

	<h3>***Project 4 Updates/Additions***</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Random type of liquid will be added into the container from a pipette. We will test 3 types of liquid first, if
			we have time, weâ€™ll do 8 types of liquid.</li>
		<li>Each wave will get progressively harder as the flood level rises, and the rate of liquids being dropped from
			above gets quicker as time goes on.
		</li>
		<li>As liquids fall from above, they will gradually fill the container from the bottom. The liquids are going to be
			draining at a constant rate. There will be a cooldown time for the player when the scientist stops adding liquids to
			get more liquids to pour into the container.
		</li>
		<li>There will be a gradual color change for the liquid in the container when a different kind of liquid is added.
			The color will become the color of the last liquid that was dropped into the container.
		</li>
		<li>Items for spider that will do the following: Increase drain rate, decrease flood rate, invincibility, and speed
			boost.
		</li>
	</ul>
